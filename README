Design goals for JOS:
* Java-based wrapper library for OpenStack, so REST calls do not have to be made directly
* option to switch between real (ie, HTTPS target) and mock mode
* in-memory storage of objects for unit testing purposes
* on-file storage of objects for visual screening purposes

Components of OpenStack and their current level of support in this component:
* Keystone (Authentication and authorization) - partially supported
* Nova (Computing) - not supported
* Swift (ObjectStore) - SUPPORTED
* Glance (ImageStore) - not supported
* Horizon (Dashboard) - not supported

Based on the OpenStack documentation:
* http://api.openstack.org/
* http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-object-storage/1.0/content/
